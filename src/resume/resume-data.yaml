        description: >
          MIA is an internal
          [Wihuri](https://www.wihuri.fi/en/)
          application with Node.js backend, React frontend and MongoDB,
          Redis as a storage. The application has been migrated from the
          on-premise to Azure cloud. Also I introduced automated tests for
          the application and configured CI/CD pipeline.
        responsibilities:
          - Design and estimate the work and communicate with the customer.
          - Containerize and adopt application so that it can run in the cloud environment.
          - Setup CI/CD with Azure Pipeline.
          - Create Bicep templates for application automated deployment.
          - Automated tests with Jest framework.
